    <h2>Tangy and flavorful topping for salads, sandwiches, and beyond</h2>
    <p>These little guys add bite both in their flavor and texture.</p>
    <p>Simple to prep, these can last over 2 weeks in your fridge and only get tastier over time</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p> I'll be using 2 onions for this recipe, but you can easily scale the ratios here to accomodate for more or less.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large red onions</li>
        <li>2 cups white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Each spice or seasoning here infuses itself into the onion, and can have quite the impact. 
    These are a few ideas, but experimentation with your favorite flavors may bring a pleasant surprise! <br>
    I'd use a maximum of 1 tablespoon per onion to avoid them becoming too overbearing, even less depending on the power of your spice.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Peppercorns</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice your red onions into slightly narrow strips.</li>
        <li>Ensure each layer of onion is separated from eachother. This is easiest to do by hand, and doesn't have to be done very carefully.</li>
        <li>In a large container with a lid, add your vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and any additional spices, and stir until the sugar has dissolved</li>
        <li>Add your onions to the mixture, ensuring that they are submerged.</li>
        <li>Cover the container with a lid, and refrigerate for a <strong>minimum</strong> of 15 minutes. <br> 
            They will continue to become more flavorful over each passing day, but may begin to lose rigidity after about a week.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Serving</h3>
        <p>This serves as a wonderful topping on a salad or sandwich, or on top of savory dips like <a href="buffalo_chicken_dip.html"> Buffalo Chicken Dip</a>.<br>
        It can be used in a pinch as a palette cleansing side for chicken or fish. </p>
