    <h1>Buffalo Chicken Dip Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Spicy, creamy, meaty dip for parties or meal prep</h2>
    <p>This recipe is great for feeding a lot of people, or just yourself for multiple days. It has a warming effect on the body,
    and will leave the body feeling full due to a high protein and fat content!
    </p>
    <p>This recipe requires a slow cooker. I will be boiling chicken breast in a medium/large pot, though a cooked rotisserie chicken 
    or canned chunk chicken work just as well. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>This is <strong>cooking</strong>, not baking, so don't need to match the amounts I recommend exactly.
    As long as each of these ingredients are present, you'll get a tasty dip.</p>
    <p>What is recommended here will create a pretty thick dip, halving the cream cheese and adding half a cup more of ranch/hot sauce
    will make things more liquidy, and you can have anywhere between 1-2 lbs of chicken without needing to adjust any other part
    of the recipe.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz cream cheese (typically 2 packs)</li>
        <li>1.5 lbs chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 cup buffalo/hot Sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>1.5 cups cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recommended Ingredients</h3>
    <p>These ingredients aren't <em>needed</em>, but they will zhuzh up your dish greatly.</p>
    <p>While you could just eat the dip with a fork, it's called a dip for a reason- I strongly recommend tortilla chips, baby
    carrots, or celery sticks to add some crunch. Many also make a sandwich using the dip, though personally I don't really like
    eating it this way.</p>
    <p>As the dip is very creamy and meaty on it's own, I've found the zing of green onion or the vinegar-y zip of pickled onions
    to add a very pleasant contrast in flavor.</p>
    <p>Lastly, it doesn't hurt to have additional seasoning to add some depth of flavor. The chicken will spend plenty
    of time in the slow cooker soaking up the flavors of our cheeses, ranch, and hot sauce, so only add what you'd like after a taste
    test at the end of the slow cooking process.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tortilla Chips/ Raw Veggie Sticks/ Bread (Dipping)</li>
        <li>Green onion/ Pickled onions (Garnish)</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, etc.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add your chicken. We'll be shredding
        and mixing the chicken directly into our sauce, so don't worry about seasoning.</li>

        <li>Allow the chicken to boil for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the cream cheese from
        the fridge during this time to give it time to soften.</li>

        <li>Remove the chicken from the pot, and shred it using forks.</li>

        <li>Cut each block of cream cheese into about 8 cubes so it may melt more easily.</li>

        <li>Add the shredded chicken, cream/cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, hot sauce to the slow cooker.</li>

        <li>Set the slow cooker to low, and stir ingredients for about 2 minutes or until they are somewhat combined.</li>

        <li>Allow to cook for 1 hour. Stir at least once after the 15 minute mark as the cream/cheddar cheeses will now be melted
        enough to fully combine with the sauces.</li>

        <li>(Optional) At about 45 minutes, taste test and add any seasoning.</li>

        <li>Switch slow cooker to warm, and serve your meal.</li>
    </ol>
