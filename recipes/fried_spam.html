    <h1>Spam Musubi Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Salty and sweet meat with a hint of nuttiness</h2>
    <p>This dish is simple and delicious, though it isn't the greatest for your health.</p>
    <p>Each bite of meat will bring pure joy to your tastebuds, and you won't want to stop once you start!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>While my preference goes towards hoisin sauce, teriyaki sauce or a simple mixture of soy sauce and sugar also work well.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of SPAM (lite or regular)</li>
        <li>1 cup of uncooked short grain rice</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tspn sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 sheets of nori seaweed paper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
    <p>These are simply for taste. I enjoy a light sprinkling of sesame seeds for the extra bit of texture, though furikake will do
    the same thing, just with a bit more flavor.</p> 
    <p>Rice vinegar, much like in sushi, gives the rice a bit more personality and helps it stay together.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Furikake</li>
        <li>Rice Vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the rice however you prepare rice, I recommend a rice cooker.</li>
        <li>Lay the SPAM on it's side, slice it evenly, anywhere between 8 to 14 slices is thin enough cook thoroughly, but not instantly crisp and burn.</li>
        <li>Heat up a pan to medium heat, and add your sesame oil to it. 
        The spam has plenty of fat to cook itself in, so just a little will do.</li>
        <li>Take one slice of spam, and use it to spread the oil around the pan. When finished, leave it at the 12 o' clock position on your pan.</li>
        <li>Continue laying your spam clockwise around the pan. Allow 3 minutes to fry.</li>
        <li>Flip the spam in the order that they have been laid.</li>
        <li>While the other side fries, apply a small dot of hoisin to each piece of SPAM, and spread it using a spoon or brush.</li>
        <li>After another 3 minutes, flip the coated SPAM and repeat this process again.</li>
        <li>Cook each side for 3-5 minutes. The heat must be kept low to allow the sugars in the sauce to caramelize without burning.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving</h3>
        <p>When finished, garnish your rice and serve. You may choose to form the rice into the shape of a SPAM slice and 
        wrap it with nori, though I like to simply rip a strip of nori, grab a clump of rice, and grab a SPAM. It's inelegant, but 
        just as delicious. </p>
